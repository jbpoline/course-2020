11. Rationale for the course:

Students in neuroscience, life sciences or medicine are facing research
projects that require them to acquire computational skills and data science
methodologies, both at conceptual and practical levels, to best visualize,
analyze and interpret an increasing number of open and large datasets within
data-set specific ethical and legal constraints. Many projects are built on
previous work or are by nature collaborative, but students often lack the
technical tools to facilitate reproducible and collaborative work. In addition,
being able to communicate reproducible analyses still remain a challenge for
many. We propose a "bootcamp" course to jointly teach the fundamentals of key
computational tools (bash, git, github, python ecosystem including jupyter,
docker, visualization) and examples of analysis methods (hypothesis testing, machine
learning) at the conceptual and at the practical levels using neuroscience
datasets.

12. Course description (100 words)

This course will teach participants how to analyse data in a reproducible and
collaborative manner using the Python software stack.  The fundamentals of both
tools (bash, git, github, jupyter, docker, visualization) and analysis methods
(hypothesis testing, machine learning) will be taught at the conceptual and
practical levels using example datasets from neuroscience and neuroimaging.
This will be an intense "hands on" bootcamp to give students a complete toolbox
for reproducible and collaborative neuro data science. Students will be
expected to have basic programming skills and to bring a laptop.

### 13:00 - Containers 

A large challenge to reproducibility lies in the fact that scientists use
different versions of different tools across different platforms and operating
systems, all of which are in constant flux. Virtual machines and containers
help to create static environments tailored to oneâ€™s analyses, which can be
easily shared. This lesson will include an overview (and interactive workshop?)
of popular containers in neuroscience, including Docker, Singularity and
Neurodocker.

**Learning objectives:** 1) Understand the difference between Virtual Machines (VMs) and containers.
